YPathScript
===========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   
During installation, Makefile.PL will check if it should use XML::LibXML 
or XML::XPath as the default xml parser. if you want to force YPS to use 
one or the other, do

	perl Makefile.PL XML_parser=XML::libXML
	or
	perl Makefile.PL XML_parser=XML::XPath


To use YPS under AxKit, add the following to your httpd.conf (the first
two lines are probably already present):

	PerlModule AxKit
	AddHandler AxKit .xml
	AxAddStyleMap application/x-ypathscript Apache::AxKit::Language::YPathScript

And to your .htaccess something like:

	<AxStyleName "#default">
	   AxAddProcessor application/x-ypathscript your_stylesheet.xps
	</AxStyleName>
